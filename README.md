# Analyzing-Kimia-Farma-Product-Sales-Using-PostgreSQL-and-Looker-Studio-for-Business-Insights
During my internship at Kimia Farma, I played a pivotal role in data management and analysis. I identified and established the primary key for the sales table, enhancing data organization and integrity. Using SQL, I executed data cleaning processes efficiently, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the dataset. I contributed to the design of a data mart, streamlining data access and analysis for the team. Additionally, I excelled in presenting my findings, interpretations, and actionable business recommendations through visually engaging PowerPoint presentations. One of my significant achievements during this internship was the development of an interactive dashboard using Looker Studio, which allowed for in-depth exploration of client characteristics data, ultimately aiding in data-driven decision-making. These experiences have not only expanded my technical skills but have also sharpened my ability to deliver valuable insights to drive business decisions effectively.
